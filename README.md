# Netflix Clone

PnetPhilx is a Netflix clone written in C++ that loads a database of 100,000 users and 20,000 movies from a text file in under a second and recommends movies to users based on their prior watch history. Pnetphilx Recommends movies to a user by finding attributes associated with movies the user has watched in the past and then identifying new movies that share as many of those attributes as possible.
